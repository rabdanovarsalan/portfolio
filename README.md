# portfolio

I have faced very significant difficulties creating this portfolio.

First, as I have confessed, I spent very little to no attention to the classes after the midterm break, due to a combination of personal issues and health problems.
The sence of inadequacy and incompetence were making me feel bad to the point I could no longer focus on web dev studies due to fear and shame.

When I came to Joanna April 13th, I explained her the situation I am in. She gave me an honorarium in the form of postponed deadline (April 20th), and she helped me enormously with the assignment.

During the 3 sessions we had, she gave me knowledge to help me create this portfolio. I was able to utilize Bootstraps for this one. It is unfinished and very far from perfect, but it was the best I could by this moment.

If it wasn't for professor Joanna Douba, I would be in too low of a spirit to have even this. She helped me to overcome my shame, guilt, and loathing, as well as boosted my aspiration to become a web developer. I am very grateful.
